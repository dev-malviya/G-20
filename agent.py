# agent.py -- the starting point. Rename this file to agent.py and build from here.

# This is a legal, complete agent. It does nothing (it holds every day), which is exactly
# what you want on day one: run it and the checks name what is missing, your group code
# (a FAIL) and your names (a warning). Fill both in and everything goes green, with one
# warning left: an agent that never has 10% of its money in shares is not placed.
# Everything else is built around this method.
#
#   python3 agent_unittest.py    protocol check, no data needed (on Windows: python)
#   python3 selfcheck.py         the same plus a real run on your group's market
#
# First, put your group code in the line below. It arrived by email at the group lock (a tutor can re-send it),
# and it looks like G07-4KQT. It is the line the checks read to know whose file this is,
# so they refuse to do much until it is there. It also decides which of the four training
# markets your report's self-check figures come from, which is why you never type a ticker
# anywhere; you build and test your agent on all four. Then replace the two lines under
# it: every member of your group, and the member who is this file's reference, the one who
# makes any live change to it at the interview.
#
# Keep agent.py, agent_unittest.py and selfcheck.py in the same folder.
